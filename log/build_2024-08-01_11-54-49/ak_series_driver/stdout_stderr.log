CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findstm32f10x.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "stm32f10x", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "stm32f10x" with
  any of the following names:

    stm32f10xConfig.cmake
    stm32f10x-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "stm32f10x" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "stm32f10x_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "stm32f10x" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
